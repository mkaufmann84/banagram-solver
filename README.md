# Banagram-Solver

This is meant to be used when playing a live game.

Through terminal input, you can add in new letters, dump a letter, redo last command, and delete characters.

When adding new letters, the structure is changed to keep as much of the existing structure as possible. This makes it so that during the live game it drastically lowers the physical changes to the tiles that need to be made.

The output after each input is a computer-generated image of the structure that highlights where new tiles need to go, and fades the parts of the previous structure that are kept the same.
